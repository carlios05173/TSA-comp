      <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Using solar energy through solar panels can help you reduce pollution in
        the world and reduce the cost of energy bill in the long run. A 2,000
        square foot home would require around $20,000 to install solar panels.
        It has even become more affordable thanks to
        <b>federal residential solar tax credit</b> for homeowners. The solar
        tax credit allows <i>taxpayers to claim 30% tax credit</i> on cost of
        solar systems. Not only that, adding solar energy into your home can
        greatly reduce electric grid use and monthly utility bill. With enough
        panels and the right environments, you may even be able to not pay
        anything for light. If that wasn't enough adding solar grids to your
        home will likely increase the value of your home.

      <p>
        <b>Residential Clean Energy Credit</b> is a credit that can be claimed
        if eligible through the use of solar, wind, or geothermal power
        generation, solar water heaters fuel cells, and battery storage. The
        percent you can claim depends on year of instalation in your home. For
        example, from 2022 to 2032, 30% with no annual limit or lifetime limit,
        in 2033 26%, and 2034 22% of credit available .
