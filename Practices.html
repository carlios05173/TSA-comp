            <h2>Clothing Expenses</h2>
            <p>The average person in america produces around <em>80 pounds</em> of clothing every year. 
            Landfills end up being filled with clothes. Through a process being called anerobic digestion, which gets caused
            due to the amount and sheer weight, The clothes decompose into methane gas.
            <br>
            A solution to this is to not overbuy clothes you know you will not wear, and eventually throw away. 
            </p>
        
                <h2>Composting Food</h2>
                
                <p>
                    If it is avalible in your city, you can drop off your food waste in a compost cite, which is a lot better than throwing it all away.
                    Food waste produces 14.5 precent of greenhouse gas emesions. Composting would prevent that precentage of greenhouse gases
                    going into the air. It would instead be used as plant fertilizer.

                <h2>Going Solar</h2>
                
                <p>
                    A method to be more carbon clean that has become more important over the modern age is solar energy. Instead of using natural gases or coal which release massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the air, they use the power of the sun. The reason more people havent
                    started utilising it is the cost. Despite this known idea, solar panels have become more offordable over time. <br>
                    Tax and rebate for solar panels:

                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Although driving in a car is comfortable and feels more private than public transportation, it is one of the biggest causes to climate change in the 21st century. 
                    Using public transportation is more effecient and causes less nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and many more gases to leak into the air. An artical by the United Nations shows that 2.2 tons of carbon pollution can be reduced every year, per person.
