        <h2>Green Energy</h2>
        <p>
          Green Energy doesn't necessarily mean alternative energy. They are
          very similar concepts, but they do have a difference. Green energy
          most typically refers to energy that can be produced with a method or
          source that doesn't harm the environment; while, alternative energy
          refers to sources that are naturally renewed such as wind, solar, and
          water energy.
